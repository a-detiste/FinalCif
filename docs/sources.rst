Source code
===========


In case you want to play with the source code, you get the `code from Github <https://github.com/dkratzert/FinalCif>`_
and do::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

The code is only useful for developers, not for users.

(FinalCif uses the great `gemmi cif parser <https://gemmi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.
It needs MSVC++ 14 in order to compile in Windows)
