Source code
===========


In case you want to play with the source code, you get the `code from Github <https://github.com/dkratzert/FinalCif>`_

``git clone 'https://github.com/dkratzert/FinalCif.git``

and do

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

The code is only useful for developers, not for users.

FinalCif uses the great `gemmi cif parser <https://gemmi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.
It needs `MSVC++ 14 <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/vs/features/cplusplus>`_ in order to compile in Windows.
For Linux and MacOS, a regular installatin of the GCC compiler is sufficient.
