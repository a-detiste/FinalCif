Database Deposition
-------------------

In order to archive CIF files and to make them publicly available, there are two major databases for deposition. The most
commonly used is the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). A junger database is the Crystallographic Open Database (COD).
While the CSD ist a commercial product with an annual pricing, the COD is open for everyone.

FinalCif has two buttons for deposition in the respective database, but they behave very differently. The button for the
CSD directs you to the CSD website only, while the button for the COD opens an upload interface in FinalCif.

The COD interface has three major options: "personal communication", "prepublication" and "already published"

personal communication
----------------------

The personal communication acts like a publication in a journal. TODO: more text here
