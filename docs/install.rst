Installation
=============

Windows
--------
Start the installer (FinalCif-setup-x64-vXX.exe) and click next until finished.

Linux
-----
FinalCif for linux needs no installation. Just download the executable FinalCif-vXX_opensuse or FinalCif-vXX_ubuntu
anywhere on you computer.
A second option for Ubuntu is to run the :ref:`installer script here <document-sources>`.

MacOS
-----
Unzip the app (Finalcif-vXX_macos.app.zip) and copy it to the Applications directory.
The app might not work in any MacOS versions. Please use the :ref:`source code installation
if necessary <document-sources>`.

Problems with 3D View
---------------------
In case you have an old operating system or run FinalCif inside a virtual machine, the 3D
view of the structure can lead to a crash. You can circumvent it by setting the environment
variable FINALCIF_NO_3D=True.


Developers
----------
FinalCif can also run directly from python. Please refer to :ref: `sources` for further instructions.
