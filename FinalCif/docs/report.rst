Report Document
===============

FinalCif is able to render a nice looking report document from the information contained in the CIF.
For a complete report, you have to finish the CIF first.
It is also advisable to deposit the file before the report generation in order to have the CCDC number
listed in the report text.

CCDC Number
-----------
There are two ways of introducing the CCDC number into the .cif file:

* Click on the template 'CCDC Number' and insert the number into the '_database_code_depnum_ccdc_archive' filed manually.

* Drag&Drop the deposition response email from the CCDC into the work folder and reload the .cif file.

Picture
-------
FinalCif can add an picture of your structure to the report document. 

* Either by previously performing an html check cif (with structure factors). Then it automatically adds a picture from the checkcif report, as in the example above.
* Or you can add any other picture with the "Picture" button.
